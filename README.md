=======================

A LinuxCNC compatible Minimalist Arduino ( ATMega328 ) Unipollar stepper controller

Skimatics and setup instructions to come later

Skimatic is done in FreePCB, That is an unverifyed skimatic I designed it from memory last night, I will verify it eather today or tomarrow, The 5 pin header next to each atmega328 goes to the mosfets, I will get that schimatic latter
